Take heart, I will find you.","I hope you have not come all this way to surrender!","NEVER! I wield the great Wand Ellon and with it, I will destroy you!","Good. Let us see how prepared you are for battle young elf.","Get moving, there is work to be done!","","By the gods we're too late","Valin, what is my purpose here? You must tell me why you've brought me to Sol.","I I don't know the Elders sent me on this Quest. I was to find and bring you to them. It all happened so quickly! The castle the battles our Clerics believed a powerful Lich had awakened","A LICH?! Areth save us even I cannot summon the magiks to destroy such an evil creature. [tremble] If I just had Valin, we must search for the Elders. They must have known something to think that I could be of use.","I don't know where to start everything is so it's hopeless!","GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF! This is your town, this is your home!! Be angry if you must but do not wallow in self pity. We've made it to Sol, now we must finish your Quest.","Forgive me. You are right. Vengeance will be mine!","Uh Oh.","Valin! Look out!","Survivors, head to the General Store! I have food and supplies!","Tathar","Crime Report:","Date: The 5th of the Moon","1 book stolen","1 Vaettir arrested","3 Worgs slain","Increased Orc activity outside of town walls.","Beware of the fog!","Day 1 We've barricaded ourselves in here to wait the invasion out.","Day 5 They're trying to get in, we can hear their claws on our door, we are so very hungry.","Day 9 They've killed my wife, my only hope is to retreat into our secret safe room.","GUARD SCHEDULE:","[unreadable, covered by a bloody handprint]","Well, well, well I see you've destroyed my trees. *chuckle* You are proving to be quite a challenge, unlike your fellow townsfolk","You? What did you do to them?! WHERE ARE THEY?","*Laughs* You cannot begin to imagine the fun we've had. Sadly, the fun didn't last as long as I had hoped. I'm afraid they're all dead.","YOU LIE!!","Valin, keep calm. Do not let this foul creature lure you into his trap.","[Shock] The talking wand how how did you get that?!","You can ponder that question in Hades' Abyss after I send your foul soul there for an eternity of torment!","*Chuckle* I will take great pleasure in prying that Wand from your lifeless fingers. My master will be pleased when I deliver him that wand. Come find me if you can!","Grrrr","Valin! Grrrrrr oh no! S..s..stay away!!","Camthal, I'm here to help","Stay away! *Growl*  I don't want to harm you argh must leave","Camthal!","Valin, he's turning. Leave him be. Unless you wish to hunt down and slay that poor creature, we should move on.","Camthal","Please go away!","Lorien by the gods!","Please, leave me alone please ARGHHH!","ADVISORY: The courtyard gates have been locked to stop the horde of creatures from proceeding into town.","Lever Locked!","There must be a way to open this gate perhaps Bob can be of use.","Bob has unlocked the gate levers!","We're overrun. I've left my post to barricade myself into safety. Lorien","What foul magic is this?!","Ponder that later! This evil is no friend. FIGHT!","[Knock Knock Knock]","Large Hole","Boulder Stuck!","Stuck Boulder","Darkfel","To Sol","Book: \"Lichcraft\"  Conquering Death for the Modern Wizard","[Defense +1]","Book: Today's Lich: Undead Wizardry for Dunderheads","[Accuracy +2]","232441","1342234","234141","1234432","By the gods! I have never seen a Wererat move like that!","Take care I do not believe that was a Wererat. If the doppelganger possesses anywhere close to the powers our good wizard has mastered, he'll be more difficult to destroy than a Lich perhaps nearly as powerful as Odin himself. Pray the powers given to us will be enough.","WHAT JUST HAPPENED? WHERE ARE WE?! Are we upsidedown on the CEILING?!","Valin, calm down! The evil wizard is trying to disrupt our senses. This room is not in Darkfel, an alternate existence perhaps, but extremely dangerous nonetheless. We must find a way out of this room.","How are we supposed to get out?! The doors are upside down or I'm upside down! This is so frustrating!","WHAT WAS THAT?!","Haunted boulders?","I doubt those boulders are harmless apparitions. You should stay clear.","*groan* Now how am I supposed to get past those?!","Their behavior may reveal something we can use to our advantage.","It seems Dareth is toying with us. *sigh* We are back in Darkfel at least.","[The inscription is in a language neither you nor Ellon understand.]","Gods of mercy, that trap was set to kill an innocent. We must put a stop to this madness!","Valin! Leave this infernal contraption! Concentrate on finding Dareth!","*sigh*","Please help me! They're killing everyone who dares to defy the wizard! I've tried to escape using this lockpick but I don't know how to use it. Can you use these to get me out?","Umm, I think I could give it a shot! [Elf hands you the lockpick set]","Welcome to Darkfel Castle; we've been expecting you!","Grolbuck like bash. Grolbuck bash you now.","At last we meet, little thief, and the powerful Ellon too. With Ellon and Abraxas reunited I will be invincible. Hahaha! Vareth has failed!","I will never serve you. As long as I exist, Vareth will NOT fail!","You are powerful, Ellon, but you will not resist me. As you have served Vareth, you will serve me. You've already done my bidding by leading this boy into my lair.","If you were indeed leading me, you could have made the journey easier. In any case, we have a matter to settle payback for what you did to Sol. Since I have Ellon, well, let's just say that a wizard has yet to steal anything from me!","Hahahaha! There is always a first time little thief. Well, I'm game for more fun. Come, my children let us play!","Stay back the vapors will turn you NOOOO!","The cauldron it's don't let him turn me! EAAARGH!","Tattered remnants of a scroll. Salvaged passage reads, overrun taking those they don't kill or turn into Napulin\"","Scuffed Blood Oath charm with the name Danserest engraved.","Smashed locket. The image inside looks familiar.","Napulin","Danserest","Mighty Abraxas,"," EMPOWER ME!","Valin! Dareth's death has destroyed his minions, but it's also destroying Darkfel! We must get out of here immediately!","You two have done well. With Dareth destroyed, the Lands can begin to recover from his siege. There is still much to be done, but you've won us a great victory. Valin, I have one final gift for you  this enchanted gem will instantly propel you to any of the lands visited on this mission. Take good care of it and use it wisely. [Received the Warp Gem].","Now, to right some of the wrongs that has been done in my absence, Mighty Abraxas will be joined with its proper master.","I call on the spirit of King Brahm, the rightful owner of this mighty warhammer. BRAHM, COME FORTH!","I have infused the warhammer with Brahm's spirit, and now I shall reunite old friends. Perhaps we will meet again Valin; and Ellon, I'm sure we will see one another very soon. Farewell.","Lever Jammed","He's trying to turn you! Use a remedy potion against his vapor!","It is good to be in fighting form again! Perhaps Eol will wield us someday.
